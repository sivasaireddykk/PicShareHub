# PicShareHub
In this project, we'll create a photo-sharing app with login, register, and image-sharing features. Using Express in Node.js for the backend API, we'll connect to MongoDB. Front-end components will be implemented for user interactions, fetching and displaying data via React. Pre-written CSS styles the app components, offering an initial template.
